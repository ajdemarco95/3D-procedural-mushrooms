# 3D Procedural Mushrooms

## Inspiration
I was inspired by the sheer size of the mushroom family (Agaricaceae), the purpose they serve in purifying our environment, and the beautiful colors they often have.

## Scope
My goal with this project was to be able to procedurally generate a mushroom shape using 3D web technologies - ThreeJS, React-Three-Fiber, and React-Three-Drei.

Currently, the algorithim produces a simple 3D mushroom using CatmullRomCurve3 line curve which is available as part of the ThreeJS library. What makes this implementation special is that the curve resembles a randomly shaped mushroom stem, similar to the way they appear in nature.
